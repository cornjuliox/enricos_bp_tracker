# What is this project?
This is a simple CLI program designed to help me keep track of blood pressure reports, and is designed to replace the spreadsheet I'm currently using. My doctor didn't ask me to do this, I just decided to do it for fun.

# What's this built with?
The major pieces are:
- Python 3.10
- Rich
- Arrow

Ignore the `tk` stuff for now, it's old and will be replaced / rewritten at some point in the future.

# Installation Instructions
The project's still in really early alpha, so its just a source installation for now.

1. Clone the repository
1. Create a virtual environment (optional but highly recommended), e.g `python -m venv .venv`
1. Install requirements with `pip freeze -r requirements.txt`
1. `python cli.py -h` for usage instructions.

# Usage Instructions
